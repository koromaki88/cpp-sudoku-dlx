# Dancing Links Sudoku Solver in C++
This is a reimplementation in C++ of my [Algorithms & Analysis](https://www1.rmit.edu.au/courses/004302) (formerly Data Structures & Algorithms) course's group project: [automatically Sudoku solver](https://github.com/ThangHoang54/AutoSudoku). The project was originally programmed in Java, with the objective to compare different Sudoku algorithm approaches - between rule-based backtracking, constraint satisfaction and exact cover. Here, I aim to mainly focus on [Donald Knuth's Dancing Links](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0011047) (DLX) use in solving Sudoku as an exact cover problem.
